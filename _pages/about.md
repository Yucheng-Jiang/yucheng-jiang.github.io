I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where I focus on developing human-centered AI systems that empower individuals in both everyday tasks and complex knowledge work. With a passion for bridging artificial intelligence and human interaction, my research aims to enhance learning, decision-making, and productivity by creating systems that collaborate seamlessly with users.

# Research project

---

**Engaged human learning through collaborative discourse with LLM agents**  
- Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab (2024 - Present)  
- Directed the development of a human-AI collartion project aimed at facilitating human-centered natural language
processing (NLP) and leveraging LLMs for enhanced human learning
- Contributed to the project’s global reach, serving over 200,000 users across 175 countries, with engagement from five
school districts in the U.S. and U.K., highlighting its educational and societal impact
- Designed and implemented a full-stack web application to enable and evaluate complex information-seeking workflows,
driving insights into human-AI interaction

**Writing wikipedia by automatic knowledge curation with LLMs**  
- Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab (2023 - Present)  
- Conceptualized and designed a cutting-edge pipeline for generating extensive Wikipedia articles autonomously, without
relying on pre-existing outlines or resources
- Achieved over 13k stars on GitHub for innovative project contributions and generated over 300,000 articles in the wild
- Led the development of an LLM-driven automatic evaluation framework to systematically assess and enhance the quality
of generated articles

**Multi-modal depression and anxiety detection during pre-visit rooming**  
- Stanford Partnership in AI-Assisted Care (2023 - 2024)  
- Led a team of four students in conducting critical experiments, utilizing cross-attention contrastive learning methods to
analyze patient data for mental health indicators
- Engaged in emergency room shadowing at the Stanford Hospital Marc and Laura Andreessen Adult Emergency
Department to identify practical applications for AI in enhancing the emergency room workflow and patient care
- Implemented a multi-modal approach, integrating data from various sources such as audio, visual, and textual patient
information to improve detection accuracy

**Long-range Context Hierarchical Seed-Guided Topic Discovery**
- UIUC Data Mining Group (2022 - 2023)
- Lead a team of three students extend topic mining framework into hierarchy structure to facilitate hierarchical taxonomy
construction and document classification
- Designed framework to leverage benefit of pre-trained language model and retrieve topic implicative document segments to
perform topic discovery in a broader context
- Achieved 8% accuracy improvement compared to all state-of-art baseline models


**Entity Set Co-Expansion in StackOverflow**
- UIUC Data Mining Group (2022 - 2023)
- Design an entity set expansion model to simultaneously expand multiple types of seed by using mutual exclusivity among
entity sets to determine expansion boundary
- Leverage generic natural language knowledge from pre-train language model to facilitate learning seed representation based
on themselves and their context simultaneously

**Seed-Guided Topic Mining**
- UIUC Data Mining Group (2021 - 2022)
- Designed an iterative topic mining framework with text embedding and pre-trained language model based representations
- Improved weakly hierarchical multi-label text classification model to test on 100 million conference papers
- Achieved 13% accuracy improvement compared to baseline models
